# Contact_Management_System
Developed a C++ console application for managing and storing contact information.

Object-Oriented Design: Utilized classes Contact and Directory to encapsulate contact data and directory functionalities, promoting code maintainability and reusability.
Comprehensive Contact Management: Implemented features for creating new contacts, editing existing ones, searching by name, and deleting unwanted contacts. Each contact stores name, phone number, and email address.
File I/O Operations: Enabled importing contacts from a text file for easy data population and exporting the entire directory data back to a file for persistence, ensuring information is not lost when the application exits.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed a menu-driven interface that provides clear instructions and allows users to navigate through various functionalities with ease.
